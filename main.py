    It's a common dilemma and the most sensible way to do it is to use a ruler.
    The only other method would be cutting up the pizza but that's not going to give you an even division and will leave you with less of the tasty stuff.
    The ruler was the preferred method of a maths teacher who recently shared a picture of a 'divider' she found in the school staff room.
    She said her colleague was "a very precise person" so they must have been doing the maths when they designed the tool.
    The image has been shared on Reddit where users were split as to which method was fairest - but many had come to a firm conclusion in favour of using the ruler.
    One wrote: "The best way to split a pizza is with a ruler, you know you have the right amount of each bit."
